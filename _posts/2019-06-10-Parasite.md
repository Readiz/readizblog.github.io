Recently, mr. Bong made the movie named "Parasite". This movie handles the gap between the rich and poor.
In the movie, The poor is very helpless, they do not plan anything and just live their lives.
The poor people do not want to be the rich. They are mooching off the rich people and they satisfied with that.

I'm very sad to see they have no hope, no dream, anything, so it's a tragic cause they even don't have any freedom to think about for that.

This is a new paradiam for the society. The world make the poor to worry about everyday's life. And it also makes them have no hope using the press and it's quite success at least as I think.

So, everything is manipulated now. They(the most smart ones who rule the world actually) learned from history. Revolution only can happen when they have some freedom and hope. These days it cannot be happening cause the life itself is so huge, massive for everybody. If they cannot earn the money for their single day, it is literally meaning social death. The proud is taken from them by the system.

"Parasite" shows these facts very well. So this is well-made movie.
