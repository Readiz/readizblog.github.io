Starting from the Marvel's the Avengers, the `Infinity Saga`(from Phase 1 to 3) is ended very well.

Russo brothers are the best commercial directors in the world, I think.
They know how to deal with the multiple character interactions and scenarios exactly--It's a very complicated job.

I also want to be like them.
Nowadays, the industry is very hard to understand it. So, the person is needed who can understand the details and deal with many objects.

Stay hungry, stay foolish -- that phrase comes from Steve Jobs. I need to keep going to fulfill my destiny.
