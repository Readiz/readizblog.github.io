title: It's been a long time
---

It's been a long time since my last writing is uploaded.
Recently, director Bong receives a hornorable prize called Oscar, and ironically, my last blog post was related with that movie.
I also felt some sort of prize-winning senses when I saw that movie. It was a well-made movie.

Anyway, I just write this to announce I'm alive, and of course, nobody cares.
And I also not care, because I just want to write something suddenly.
If the writing becomes an obligation, then it will be a burden. I don't want that.

So, I'll upload the article from time to time, and please don't expect anything.
Maybe, someday, I'll write regularly when I find something interest to describe. Who knows?
