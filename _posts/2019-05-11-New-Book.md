title: New Book
---

I used to use my old tablet (Galaxy Tab S2 8.0), but it's too old to use now.
Battery time is short and the performance is not too good and also, it's android, so the productivity is bad comparing to typical Windows.

So I made up my mind and bought a brand new Galaxy Book 2. It's very new and smells good when it's finally arrived at my home.
The biggest feature is build-in LTE, of course. You can access to the Internet anytime regardless of Wi-Fi nearby.

I'm worried about AP, because it's Snapdragon, instead of x64 that uses in Notebook typically.
But x86 applications are supproted well in simulated mode, so I have no feelings of inconvenience about compatibility.

About performance, yeah it have some issue. it's not fast, obviously.
However, the battery time is enormous, so there's some trade-offs between them.

Anyway, it's just 2 days since I got my brand new Galaxy Book 2, so I will repost about the dailylif feelings about it later also.
